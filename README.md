val sparkVersion = "2.3.1"
val analyticsZooVersion = "0.3.0"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % sparkVersion,
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-mllib" % sparkVersion,
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % sparkVersion
)
libraryDependencies += "com.intel.analytics.zoo" % "analytics-zoo-bigdl_0.7.1-spark_2.3.1" % analyticsZooVersion
```
